Almost every single family has certain traits that you consider a core part of being a member of said family by blood. Be it an aspect in regards to their personality, mental stability, or a physical aspect. For my family, at least on my father's side, we have something called the Kirkpatrick nose. A big ol fat schnoz in the center of the head. Luckily this skipped me, but a conversation about it this past Christmas got me thinking about what other facial aspects can be found in common with members of my father's and mother's family. That's the goal of this project, to try and calculate chance of kinship via facial analysis utilizing CNNs.
